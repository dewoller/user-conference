#Data is beautiful
  * So much data!
  * Advances in hardware and software mean that predictions will get cheap, so...
  * the things 'around' prescriptions will get valuable
  * Data is the new oil
  * we are the oil drillers, the road builders, the car manufacturers

# R
  * R makes data comprehendable - data toolkit
  * R used to be like Perl - dense, feature packed, imcomprehendable
    * tidyverse makes it beautiful
    * but still dense and feature packed!

# Administrative Medical Data
  * Australian Medical/Pharmaceutical Benefit Summary  (MBS / PBS)
  * what can you do with opioids?
## Technical fun facts - Daily Defined Dose (DDD)
  * DDD is standardised drug dose (daily dose per 1000 people) 
  * World Health Organisation.  Used for comparing different types of drugs.  
  * In opioids, it is the cancer dosage level, so kind've high.  Cancer hurts!

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Increasing and Decreasing Opioid Usage for NSW", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("opioid1.png")
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regular Opioid users - Years LGA at highest quartile for NSW and VIC", out.width = '80%'}

### Fun with Opioids (1) - Boxplot all variable combinations
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Drug category and urbanisation - Australia", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("boxplot_type_name_urbanization4.png")
```

### Fun with Opioids (2) the Census
  * Opioids  
    * DDD x Local Government Area (LGA)
  * Census 
    * 15000 categories x LGA 
  * How about joining them together?

# Top 10 Highly Coorelated 2011 Census Variables with Opioid Usage by LGA
```{r , echo=FALSE}

 read.csv("top_10_census.csv") %>% 
   mutate( long_name = gsub('_',' ',  substr( long_name, 13,999))) %>% 
   select( long_name) %>% 
   rename( `Census Category` = long_name ) %>%
   kable( )

# How do people take their pills?
* what is relationship of prescribing data to consumption?

# Medical Data Availability
## Australian Government Generosity
 * Released 20 years of MBS, 10 years of PBS data
 * 10% of Australia population
 * Released under Creative Commons 4.0 license
 * can also request other data

##Data Heterogenaity

 * 7614 PBS Drugs
 * 5344 MBS Services 

## Outstanding tricky bits
 * How can we distribute it?
 * How to anonymize it?
